            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am someone who believes that perfection isn’t everything—instead, I focus on <b>growth</b> and <b>possibilities</b>. When things don’t go as planned, I remain <b>flexible</b> and find ways to adapt, taking challenges step by step. I embrace mistakes as <b>opportunities</b> to learn rather than reasons to panic.
                With a <b>creative mindset</b> and an eye for <b>improvement</b>, I constantly look for ways to make a <b>difference</b>, no matter how small the action. I’m <b> curious</b> about how small ideas can have a big impact, and I ask myself how my actions or projects can bring <b>positive change</b>.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending <b>quality moments</b> with friends and family, whether it’s chatting over coffee at cozy cafés or enjoying the energy of live music at concerts. I love <b>discovering </b>new experiences, and it’s my <b>dream</b> to one day explore the world and everything it has to offer.</p>
            <p> I’m a <b>caring</b>, <b>optimistic</b>, and <b>determined</b> individual who finds joy in <b>learning and evolving</b>. My approach is to focus on what is possible rather than what isn’t, and to stay <b>engaged</b> and independent while always being <b>open to collaboration</b>.
                By staying <b>flexible</b>,<b> involved</b>, and <b>forward-thinking</b>, I make it my goal to <b>grow</b> both as a <b>person</b> and as a <b>creator</b>.</p>

               <hr>
               <p>My mother has always encouraged me to try things myself before asking for help. This approach has guided me through many challenges and fostered a sense of curiosity in me to continually explore and try new things.</p>

                <p>Embracing the value of living in the moment has always been important to me.

                <h3>“Be kind”</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>In life's journey, it's important to always be kind to yourself, enabling you to extend kindness to others. It's a principle I cherish, perhaps why my mother named me Joy – to radiate joy within myself and share it with others.</p>
